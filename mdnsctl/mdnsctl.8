.Sh NAME
.Nm mdnsctl
.Nd control the Multicast DNS server daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar command
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program controls the
.Xr mdnsd 8
daemon, it can perform simples mDNS lookups, as well as browsing and publishing
mDNS/DNS-SD services.
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx
.It Xo
.Cm lookup
.Op Ar rr-types
.Ar host.local
.Xc
Look up resource records for
.Ar host.local .
The optional
.Ar rr-types
specifies which type of resource record should be looked up.
It can be any combination of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "   " -compact
.It Cm -a
A record (IPv4 Address). This is the default.
.It Cm -h
HINFO record (Host Information).
.It Cm -s
SRV record (Service). Unimplemented.
.It Cm -t
TXT record (Text). Unimplemented.
.El
.It Cm rlookup Ar a.b.c.d
Reverse lookup an IPv4 address in the
.Ar a.b.c.d
form, use this to obtain the hostname of the given
address.
.It Xo
.Cm browse
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl s
.Op Ar application proto
.Xc
Browse for application services of type
.Ar application
for the given transport protocol
.Ar proto .
.Ar application
may be any application service type, like http, workstation, ftp, printer...
.Ar proto
must be either tcp or udp.
Defaults to all services if none specified.
.It Xo
.Cm publish
.Ar service-name
.Ar application
.Ar proto
.Ar port
.Ar text-string
.Xc
Publish services via dns-sd,
.Ar service-name
is the unique chosen name for the service, it can be any string up to 63
characters.
The
.Ar application
is the application protocol for the service, like http, ftp...
.Ar proto
is the transport protocol, must be either tcp or udp.
.Ar port
is the tcp or udp port.
.Ar text-string
is the string in the TXT record for the given service, it can be used to
express additional service information.
.It Xo
.Cm proxy
.Ar service-name
.Ar application
.Ar proto
.Ar port
.Ar host
.Ar address
.Ar text-string
.Xc
Proxy publish a service running on a different machine,
in addition to the arguments used for
.Sx \&publish ,
.Ar host
is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the target machine,
.Ar address
is an IPv4 address for the target machine in the
.Ar a.b.c.d
form.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/run/mdnsctl.sockXX" -compact
.It Pa /var/run/mdnsctl.sock
.Ux Ns -domain
socket used for communication with
.Xr mdnsd 8 .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following examples demonstrate some basic uses of
.Nm .
.Pp
Lookup a host A and HINFO record
.Pp
.Dl # mdnsctl lookup -ah foobar.local
.Pp
Reverse lookup an address
.Pp
.Dl # mdnsctl rlookup 192.168.8.32
.Pp
Browse up all services in the local network
.Pp
.Dl # mdnsctl browse
.Pp
Browse and resolve all services
.Pp
.Dl # mdnsctl browse -r
.Pp
Browse and resolve all services and output in script-readable format
.Pp
.Dl # mdnsctl browse -rs
.Pp

.Pp
.Dl # mdnsctl browse -r http tcp
.Pp
Publish a simple ftp service
.Pp
.Dl # mdnsctl publish myftp ftp tcp 21 "user=foobar"
.Pp
Proxy publish a https service that has www.mysite.com as the target
.Pp
